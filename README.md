## Overview

### Official

Provided and supported by Red Hat, official Templates and ImageStreams are listed in the top level of this repository, making it easy for developers to get started creating applications with the newest technologies.

You can check to see which of the official Templates and ImageStreams are available in your OpenShift cluster by doing one of the following:

- Log into the web console and click **Add to Project**
- List them for the openshift project using the **Command Line Interface**

    $ oc get templates -n openshift  
    $ oc get imagestreams -n openshift

### Community

Community templates and image streams are **not** provided or supported by Red Hat. This curated list of community maintained resources exemplify OpenShift best practices and provide clear documentation to serve as a reference for other developers.

## Building the Library

### Python Dependencies

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Command Line Options

    usage: import_content.py [-h]

    Build OpenShift template and image-stream library

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help       show this help message and exit
      --online    Import Online-specific templates and imagestreams

### Running the Script

    $ python import_content.py

## Contributing

### Adding Your Template or ImageStream

- Fork the https://github.com/openshift/library on github
- Add your template or image stream to the **community.yaml** file in the top level of this project
- Run the **import_content.py** script and make sure that your template(s) and/or image-stream(s) are processed and written to the correct directory under the **community** folder and that no errors have occurred.
- Commit your changes to your fork of the github repo
- Create a pull request against the https://github.com/openshift/library upstream repository

That's it!  Your pull request will be reviewed by a member of the OpenShift Team and merged if everything looks good.


### YAML file structure:

    variables: # (optional) top level block item
      <variable_name>: <value> # (optional)
    data: # (required) top level block item
      <folder_name>: # (required) folder that the below items will be stored in
        imagestreams: # (optional) list of image-streams to process into the above folder
          - location: # (required) github url to a json file or folder of json files
            regex: # (optional) matched against ['metadata']['name'] in the json file
            suffix: # (optional) suffix for the file that is created ex: ruby-<suffix>.json
            docs: # (optional) web address of the documentation for this image-stream
            # These below options are for OpenShift Online usage only to import Online-specific templates/imagestreams
            openshift: # (optional) flag for OpenShift
              online: # (optional) flag for OpenShift Online
                - starter # (optional) flag for OpenShift Online Starter
                - professional # (optional) flag for OpenShift Online Professional
        templates: # (optional) list of templates to process into the above folder
          - location: # (required) github url to a template or folder of templates in json format
            regex: # (optional) matched against ['metadata']['name'] in the json file
            suffix: # (optional) suffix for the file that is created ex: ruby-<suffix>.json
            docs: # (optional) web address of the documentation for this template
            # These below options are for OpenShift Online usage only to import Online-specific templates/imagestreams
            openshift: # (optional) flag for OpenShift
              online: # (optional) flag for OpenShift Online
                - starter # (optional) flag for OpenShift Online Starter
                - professional # (optional) flag for OpenShift Online Professional

#### Variables

Anything under the **data** block can contain a reference to a variable by using the following syntax:

    {variable_name}

You must also specify a value for that variable name under the **variables** block with the following syntax:

    <variable_name>: <value>

#### Organization

The **folder_name** is a folder which represents a logical grouping for a set of templates or image-streams.  Listings in the **community.yaml** file will be created in a sub folder of the  **community** top level folder.

For "online" option, templates are imported into <free/paid>/templates/examples/ directory while imagestreams are imported into <free/paid>/imagestreams/

#### location

The **location** must be a publicly available url that points to either a template, image-stream, or image-stream list file in JSON or YAML format

#### docs

The **docs** is a field to list the web address of the documentation for the template, image-stream, or image-stream list

#### regex

The **regex** is a plain string that is matched against the ['metadata']['name'] element in the template or image-stream.  Make sure that the **regex** string that you provide is descriptive enough to only match the ['metadata']['name'] that you are trying to target.

#### suffix

The **suffix** is applied to the end of the filename that is created right before the .json file extension and can contain dashes (-) or underscores (_).
